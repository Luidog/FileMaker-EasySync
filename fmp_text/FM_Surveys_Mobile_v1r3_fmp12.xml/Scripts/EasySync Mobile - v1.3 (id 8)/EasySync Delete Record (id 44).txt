#EasySync Delete Record:Handles the deletion of records in synced tables. Logs the UUID of the record that is to be deleted, and then deletes the record. The UUIDs of deleted records are stored in the EasySync_Payloads table, and then passed to the server during the next sync (at which point they are deleted from the server as well).Parameters:Position 1: The type of record to be deleted. Record or Portal Row are supported. This determines how the record itself is deleted (using either Delete Record or Delete Portal Row). This param is required.Position 2: The ES_Record_UUID of the record to be deleted. This param is required.Position 3: The word to use to describe the object to be deleted. ex: Survey Document. This is an optional param.Note: Params should be passed as a return-delimited list.Example Calls: Record¶  Surveys::ES_Record_UUID  ¶surveyPortal Row¶  Survey_Hobbies::ES_Record_UUID  ¶hobbyHistory:2014-04-30	Tim Dietrich (timdietrich@me.com)	Initial version. I tried to avoid having to require params for this, but havent found a way 	to determine in what context the script has been called. In other words, I cant tell whether the 	script has been called in such a way that a record is to be deleted, or if a portal row is to be 	deleted. Additionally, in the case of a portal row, I cant determine what the the ES_Record_UUID.2014-05-05	Tim Dietrich (timdietrich@me.com)	Added step to load ES settings.
