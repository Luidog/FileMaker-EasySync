 * HISTORY:

 *
 * NOTES:
 *		Things we want to see at high volume in case we need to forensically
 *		analyze an issue. System lifecycle events (system start, stop) go here.
 *		 "Session" lifecycle events (login, logout, etc.) go here. Significant
 *		boundary events should be considered as well (e.g. database calls,
 *		remote API calls). Typical business exceptions can go here (e.g. login
 *		failed due to bad credentials). Any other event you think you'll need
 *		to see in production at high volume goes here.
