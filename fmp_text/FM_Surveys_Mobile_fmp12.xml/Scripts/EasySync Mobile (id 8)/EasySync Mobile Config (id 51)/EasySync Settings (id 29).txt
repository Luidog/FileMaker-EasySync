#EasySync Settings:Initializes all EasySync mobile settings.History:2014-04-16			Tim Dietrich (timdietrich@me.com)	Initial version, based on settings that had been local to the push / pull scripts.2014-04-18		Tim Dietrich (timdietrich@me.com)	Added "client_version" setting. Can be used by the server to confirm that the 	client meets sync requirements, and either notify the usser that a new version is	available, or reject the sync.2014-04-19		Tim Dietrich (timdietrich@me.com)	Added support for "additional ping info" which can be used by the developer to send	additional info to the server during the ping / handshake process.	Added support for "max ping time" and "slow connection behavior" which can be used	to warn the user, or abort the sync, when a slow connection to the server is detected.	Added support for "additional push info" which can be used by the developer to send	additional info to the server during the push phase of the sync process.	Added support for "additional pull info" which can be used by the developer to send	additional info to the server during the pull phase of the sync process.2014-04-24	Tim Dietrich (timdietrich@me.com)	Added "$$process_deletions" setting, which gives you the option to enable / disable	the new "deletion" phase of the sync process.2014-06-02	Tim Dietrich (timdietrich@me.com)	Changed deletion settings, and added new "sync check" settings.	Added support for "$$pull_progress_indicator_logic" setting.

The "2AM rule" applies here- if you're on call, do you want to be	woken up at 2AM if this condition happens? If yes, then log it as	"error".2	Warn	An unexpected technical or business event happened, customers may be	affected, but probably no immediate human intervention is required. On	call people won't be called immediately, but support personnel will	want to review these issues asap to understand what the impact is.	Basically any issue that needs to be tracked but may not require	immediate intervention.3	Info	Things we want to see at high volume in case we need to forensically	analyze an issue. System lifecycle events (system start, stop) go here.	"Session" lifecycle events (login, logout, etc.) go here. Significant	boundary events should be considered as well (e.g. database calls,	remote API calls). Typical business exceptions can go here (e.g. login	failed due to bad credentials). Any other event you think you'll need	to see in production at high volume goes here.4	Debug	Just about everything that doesn't make the "info" cut. Any message	that is helpful in tracking the flow through the system and isolating	issues, especially during the development and QA phases. We use "debug"	level logs for entry/exit of most non-trivial methods and marking	interesting events and decision points inside methods.5	Trace	For extremely detailed and potentially high volume logs that you don't	typically want enabled even during normal development. Examples	include dumping a full object hierarchy, logging some state during	every iteration of a large loop, etc.*/ ]
